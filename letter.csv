Mr. Jacques Cory

International Business Program

Haifa 34981

Israel

Dear Jacques,

I would like to express to you my appreciation of the efficient manner in which
you helped AG Associates to establish a subsidiary in Israel and find a strategic
partner to the subsidiary and the parent company.

Your contribution was key to obtaining an approved enterprise status, R&D
grants, and all the government incentives, on the most favorable conditions.
Your most vital and gost effective contribution was in finding the partner,

conducting the business negotiations, and streamlining the contractual
negotiations.

In my opinion, you quickly acquired sufficient understanding of our business to
present a thorough business plan, including the financial feasibility study for the

Israeli subsidiary and a detailed substantiation of the valuation of the parent
company.

The business plan, together with the meetings and negotiations that you
conducted subsequently, were instrumental in convincing the strategic partner
of the validity of the project, as well as the proper valuation of the companies.

Your professional and business-like approach, combined with your ability to
distinguish between the crucial issues and those of lesser importance, your

efficiency, integrity, motivation and sense of humor in difficult moments, made
it a pleasure to work with you on this project.

Finally, I would like to commend your independent mode of working that
enabled you to conduct most of the negotiations with minimum assistance from
headquarters and almost no disturbance to their normal work routine.

        

I sincerely hope and plan to have you continue to assist us in other projects, and
wish you every success in new ventures that you will undertake in the future.
It will be my pleasure to provide references for any new clients as needed.

Sincerely,

11,letter,"Scholarship cover letter

Few people can cook up savvy cover letters, especially when applying for a
scholarship when you are a single mother. Not because you are single mom. However,
because I have already forgotten what it's like to do something that does not involve
household or children matters. Don't worry, you're not alone, writing cover letters for
scholarship application is not easy for everyone too.

Scholarships for mothers program has already been spread widely across the country.
So when a mother will take an interest in this, she'll have to go through the process of
applying. Since eligibility is being a mother, check. Now when ask for filing an
application, this will involved not just government forms to fill up but also a cover
letter.

A cover letter is needed to serve as an introduction of one's intent for submitting
attached documents. It does suppose to complement with the accompanying
documents. For application of scholarships, a poorly written cover letter may cost an
applicant the chance of availing a scholarship grant.

In order to ensure a scholarship, follow simple guidelines that would lead to write a
winning cover letter. When about to write, take note of what program of study you are
applying a scholarship for. This will matter in your letter, if you are not sure of this,
don't apply. Just remember your letter will be direct, brief but respectful.

Now it should start with the usual format for writing formal letters, like letterhead,
addressee and destinations address. Start with proper salutations, then the body of the
letter.

In the body of the letter, the first lines of the paragraph should be mentioning the
reason for applying scholarships for mothers program. What program of study you
have chosen. Explain your situation briefly but formally. Do not inject too much
drama, lest it sounds deliberate and fake.

In the middle of the body, explain how availing a scholarship will greatly affect your
life as mother in supporting your family. It is wise also to mention that availing
scholarship for mothers program will give you deep self-satisfaction.

The concluding part of the letter should mention about appreciating this government
program. It's also good to mention gratitude for such an opportunity that even mothers
like you are given attention by the government. Then include your hope for a
favorable response, and then wait."

SEFI's member of the Administrative Council

SEFI has evolved over the years to become a leader in engineering and engineering
technology education. We are now at a critical moment in our history - SEFI's global
efforts have positioned us as a leading organization in Europe and also worldwide.
Through our cooperation with the International Society for Engineering Education
(IGIP), the Asociacion Iberoamericana de Instituciones de la Ensefianza de la
Ingenieria (ASIBET) and as a founding member of the International Federation of
Engineering Education Societies (IFEES), we have had a significant global impact on
engineering education. SEFL can help shape the future of engineering and
engineering technology education in a time of constantly changing demands. We
can make SEFI the voice of engineering and engineering technology education. If
this is to occur, however, we must communicate with one another and provide
services that address the needs of every SEFI member.

Our society's accomplishments so far are excellent, yet, by talking to SEFI members
other opportunities for improving engineering and engineering technology education
can be addressed, e.g. attract increased research funding, increase communication
with the public and government officials, strengthened student associations'
interaction, support more closely the engineering professionals...

The Administrative Council plays a significant role in the life of SEFL since it is
responsible for the general policy of the Society. It is important to maintain the
efforts to advance the overall SEFI's agenda by supporting the existing working
groups and in some cases by creating new workgroups. It is also important to
expand our outreach, and engage SEFI's membership in our mission of educating
tomorrow's leaders.

As a senior engineering educator I have served in several positions on international
cooperation efforts. These included leadership roles in the field of engineering and
engineering education. With such varied experience in I feel confident that I can add
some value by serving as a member of the Administrative Council.

Members are involved because SEFI provides an opportunity to meet and talk with
peers. I know that we all agree on the elevating of the status and the enhancing of
the role of our profession. I am committed to help SEFI to maintain a leading
position on the future of engineering and engineering technology education.

Re: Medical Clerkship

Dear Madam or Sir,

I am a 4th year medical student at Mainz University in Germany. I would like to apply for an
elective period (one month) at Banting University Medical School, preferably in the paediatrics
department.

The clinical subjects that I studied during the last three semesters were the physical
examination of patients, emergency medicine, general pathology, clinical chemistry,
pharmacology, microbiology, public hygiene, industrial medicine, forensic science, and internal
medicine.

Paediatrics is, however, my preferred branch because it includes nearly all major medical
fields, and, besides, I enjoy working with children. I have already gained more than average
experience in this area, having worked in the University's paediatrics department as a part-time
auxiliary nurse since November 2002. I have already completed elective periods in gynaecology
and obstetrics at another Mainz hospital (Hildegardis Hospital), where I attended and assisted
at several births.

As I am seriously considering specializing in paediatrics after I qualify as an M.D., I am
keenly interested in acquiring more theoretical knowledge and practical skills in this area,
especially in the taking of medical histories and nursing care. I would hope to being given the
opportunity to learn a great deal from clinical staff at Banting University Medical School,
helping with history taking and P.E., also being present at rounds and when various medical
procedures are performed. In addition, I would hope to be able to take part in appropriate
programmes of further education, should these be on offer,

It might be appropriate to mention that I am reasonably familiar with laboratory work,
Experimental work is required for my doctoral thesis which is under way at the institute of
human genetics.

It is my hope learn more about medical education and health care systems in other countries,
and to experience other methods of hospital organisation and provision of medical care. Canada
is my first choice as a foreign country for my clerkship, both because fellwo students have
spoken very highly of medical education there, and because I visited Canada in summer 1996
and fell in love with the country. I am very eager to return, if possible, this summer.

I enclose a curriculum vitae and a reference from the Dean of the Mainz University Medical
School. Please contact me if you require any further details or documents (e.g. certificates for
courses I passed). I hope to hear from you in the near future.

Yours faithfully,"

MEMORANDUM

Date: October 7, 2003

From: Ed Adams, Director of Agriculture and Natural Resource Programs
To: County Chairs with WSU Master Gardener Programs

Subject: Master Gardener Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)

Last March I sent a notice to county chairs requesting completion of a MOA with Master
Gardener non-profit organizations by July 1, 2003. In addition, each chair received copies of
the attached template for the MG MOA and an example of a demo garden MOA.

As you read the attached statement from the Assistant Attorney General (AG) urging the
completion of these MOAs, please note that this process pertains to ""each MG organization,
no matter what their IRS designation or status ... if the MG group uses any WSU resources
(use of the WSU MG name and logo, staff time, office space, office equipment and supplies
and use of any WSU internet networks, etc).""

Some counties have combined WSU MG programs and may not require separate MOAs.
Each of these county chairs needs to make copies of the signed MOA and forward the original
to the Assistant AG. The AG Office will forward the originals to Business Affairs for final
signature and archiving.

Because each demo garden MOA is unique, chairs need to work directly with the Assistant
AG to discuss whether or not they need a demo garden MOA. The chair should be prepared
to provide the names of the various agencies that partner with their MG volunteers at each
demo garden and how those partners are involved. The Assistant AG will assist in
customization, review, approval, and finalization of an approved demo garden MOA.

Please direct general questions to me and MOAs and specific questions to the Assistant
Attorney General, Washington State University, PO Box 641031, Pullman, WA 99164-1031,

Dear Sir/Madam

I am writing to apply for teacher internship program 2012 at Ministry of Education .
Through my undergraduate studies, participation in various competitions, and co-curricular
activities, I believe that I am a suitable candidate for this program.

Since I was a secondary student, mathematics has been a subject that I was interested
and skilled in. This interest aptly manifested itself by driving me to participate and won several
mathematics competitions. Moreover, the flames of this interest were further stoked in my
enrollment at the Applied Mathematics Undergraduate Degree Program in NUS. In reality, my
passion in mathematics was not developed overnight. I was once trapped in negative mindset of
learning mathematics until my teacher enlightened me with his teaching method. That
experience inspired me to pass on my experience to younger generations.

Through my experience at NUS, I was taught that subject expertise is not enough.
Beyond that, I believe that a teacher must also be a holistic individual who is able to educate
the students for life outside the classroom. One should be able to inspire in students sound
moral values such as honesty, and also be a good role model for students. In addition, teachers
must also be clear and effective in communication. To hone this aspect, I decided to take up a
course in professional communication and a public speaking series in NUS, and also a Student
Leadership Certification Program during my exchange in Canada. The lessons taught to me
were invaluable and I would love the opportunity to further enhance this skill set of mine in my
student internship.

With worldwide acclaimed curriculum and the opportunity of advancements in three
different tracks, working with MOE has been my long-term dream. I am confident that, with
my academic and non-academic skills, I can take care of Singapore's greatest asset: the young

Dear Mrs Modra,

I am responding to your advertisement in the Hospodarske noviny (8-11-07) for the
position of Finance Director, in an international development company.

The described scope of responsibilities is very interesting to me. | have gained solid
financial experience as a Financial Manager with my current employer, BBB a.s.
Currently, I am responsible for accounting, planning, reporting, managing payable and
receivables, plus tax and treasury. | also led several projects, which were focused on
implementing and increasing effectiveness of processes and on improving the financial
rating of the company.

I have gained valuable 'know-how' with development companies when | was an Audit
Manager with CCC, where most of my clients were from this sector. With my future
career steps, | would like to connect finance and development areas. The advertised
position appears to be a very good opportunity for me.

Throughout my career I have acquired solid management skills, especially experience
with leading people, managing processes and implementing change management
projects. Due to constant changes in accounting regulations I am accustomed to working
with new information and actively improving my knowledge.

Further information about my career path can be found in the attached CV. I would

INTER - DIOCESAN CONSULTATION
MOTIVATIONAL LETTER
""Africa, rise up, take up your pallet, and walk"" (Jn 5; 8).
Introduction.

""Africa is not helpless. Our destiny is still in our hands. Africa is already moving; and the Church is
moving with her, offering her the light of the Gospel. The waters may be turbulent. But with our gaze
on Christ the Lord (cf Mt 14; 28-32), we shall make it safely to the port ..."" No 43

With these closing words from the final message of the second Synod of Africa the Bishop invite us
to listen to God, to one another and to the world around us, in an atmosphere of prayer and
reflection. We your Bishops of SACBC invite the whole Church at this moment of transition and
kairos to engage in a struggle for the soul of Southern Africa in an inter-diocesan consultation.

The Previous Consultation

In the 1980's the Catholic Church engaged in an inter-diocesan consultation involving all Catholics
to respond to the struggle for justice and transformation. From our rich sharing there resulted the
Pastoral Plan, Community Serving Humanity, which has borne much fruit.

Our conditions of life in Southern Africa and in the world have changed radically since then. It is
time to meet again, to share our concerns and hopes and to do so in the light of our faith. The

Church needs to evaluate its Pastoral Plan in the light of our new world of 2010.

Present day pastoral challenges

We face new challenges in Southern Africa today. We thank God for the peaceful transition to
independence and for our new democracy and freedom. We are people of many talents in a country
of great potential. We are part of that Africa of which Pope Benedict said was 'the spiritual lung' of
humanity today.

However, as Christians we find elements which unsettle us. There is a loss of Christian vision. The
Bible as a source of morality and ethics is often replaced by worldly values. Traditional values are
abandoned and corruption and mismanagement are rampant in administration. Some constitutional
decisions are at odds with Gospel values and agnostic lobby groups are influential.

Urbanisation creates problems of housing, poverty and crime. The divide between the rich and the
poor is increasing and many feel betrayed. With the scourge of HIV Aids our society is ravaged and
education is for many a failure. Christian values are rarely emphasised in parliament and public
debate. The family and the family values are under severe assault often in the name of the
constitution.

Urgent need for faith formation

We feel the voice of the Catholic Church has weakened. Though the Church played a leading part
in education and health care in the past this role is now sidelined and ignored. While we put
emphasize on Welfare, Aids Ministry and Justice and Peace over the past 30 years there would"

SAMPLE LETTER OF MOTIVATION 1

Dear Sirs,

I am interested in working for a Tour Operator. I have knowledge of the way travel
agencies work because of my professional experience in Spain and my degree in
Tourism.

I would like to have experience in a British environment to gain knowledge of the
working style of a Tour Operator in England and also to improve my English.

My professional experience in a travel agency is in selling by telephone, explaining the
itinerary of a trip, the different choices of accommodation and finally the price.
Afterwards, I contacted the office of the foreign country, by email, to book the trip and
finally I confirmed that the trip is booked to the customer. I have also worked in the flight
department to prepare the flight tickets and in the documentation department doing the
vouchers for the customers.

My main goals are learning how the business sells its product to its customers (by
telephone and / or internet), how many services it offers for each product, what kind of
hotels they work with, what the market target is, what the best strategy to decide a

suitable price is, etc.

I am not looking for a specific department; however, the marketing and sales department
would be the most interesting for me.

Thank you very much in advance for your help.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely,

Since I was child I was dreaming about studying or working abroad. Program Erasmus is
according to me the best way how to leave the country for a while and fulfill my dream.

Many people told me, that in times when I was a toddler such study experience as
Erasmus was not even a fiction. Today, 20 years later, you can freely travel over 27 states
just with your ID and pay with one currency to 500 million citizens of EU.

The main reason which is pushing me to apply for program Erasmus is to watch and learn
from foreigners how to solve different and common problems in a different way. | am sure,
that when you are abroad, you start comparing your home country with the one you are
visiting. For example you start with public transport, road building, traffic signs; continue
with architecture, style, country and end with nation favorite free-time activities, hobbies
and night life. Observing these details make you think different and look on the problems
with different eyes.

Second reason for applying is to learn a new language and improve my knowledge of
English. Because during the study in my mother tongue | haven't got many opportunities to
improve my foreign language skills, and absolutely no time to learn a new language.

Studying abroad is of course connected with meeting new people, making new contacts
and traveling. Although the main goal of Erasmus stay is still in the field of study, from my
previous experiences | think it is great to personally get to know people from different
states of Europe and talk with them on a same level about a same topic (sport, music,
movies, .

From all the students | know in my field of study | am not the best, but I am the only one
who has the courage and the will to study abroad. Any working or studying experience is
valuable and counts in my CV or increases my value on the labour market."

As a student of English Department, Faculty of Teacher Training and Education in
University of Muhammadiyah Malang, I learn how to gain access to professional practices in
diverse area of educational activities.

I wish to apply for Erasmus Mundus Program because of three very important
reasons.

First, in Indonesia, the Ministry of Education and Culture always renewals the
conceptual framework of curricular theory because it is important for upgrading the education
development. Therefore, I want to study at University of Minho which is leading 1st Cycle in
Education. However, that program is relevance with my faculty which also discusses about
theory and curricular development. It is a chance for me to acquire the lesson deeper and
various perspectives and being expert in curriculum. In addition, I believe that would be
useful for me and education in my home country by sharing to people and publishing in
media such as handbook, articles, and newspaper.

Second, I am now a coordinator of Insan Cita Education Center (ICEC), a Non
Government Organization (NGO) which focuses on discussing of current educational issues,
conducting teaching-learning activities for poor-children, holding social activities and
building networking. If I study in Europe especially Portugal, I will drum up this organization
because I will have opportunities to build an international network of education, and to share

educational issues among the participants. In addition, I found Education for Sustainable

Development (ESD) course at 1st Cycle in Education; it would support our goals of ICEC.

Last, I am very interested in learning Portuguese language because it is one of the
most widely spoken languages in the world and had a close history with Indonesia since 500
years ago. Besides, I will understand their culture and norms automatically. Furthermore, I
will promote Indonesian culture over there. When going back to my country, I will teach
Portuguese and share its culture to my friends, lecturers, and organizations because I found
no Portuguese course in my hometown. Hopefully, we work out bridging the gap through
culture.

Finally, studying at University of Minho will give many benefits in education, social,
and cross culture understanding not only for me but also for Indonesian and European

countries, especially Portugal."

Dear Sir, Madam,

In this motivation I would like to introduce myself and motivate why I would like to participate in
your EVS project.

My name is Anna van Raaij. I am a seventeen year old girl, and I live in the Netherlands. I first will
tell you something about myself. I am a friendly, polite and honest person who is open-minded to new
ideas and influences. I have a curious character and therefore am eager to learn new things and am
interested in the people around me. I am communicative and 1 like to involve others in projects and
creative ideas, ranging from doing a simple school assignment together to writing and shooting our
own movie. My biggest hobby is theatre. I love acting but I also enjoy going to the theatre and writing
plays myself. I also like to spend my time by making photographs and movies, going out with friends,
playing the piano, dancing and listening to music.

I just finished secondary school and I have now arrived at a point in my life where I have to make
decisions that are vital for my future. When I had to choose what to study next I initially wanted to
study at the drama school because I have loved theatre all my life. I did audition but unfortunately I
didn't get through the last round. Therefore, I now think that I should explore the world prior to
committing to such an education, so I can broaden my mind about life and about myself. That is why I
choose to go volunteering for one year.

I enjoy doing voluntary work because I want to make myself useful in the world, and get new
experiences of which I can learn and with which I can help others in need. I am very curious to other
cultures and different ways of living, which is why I am interested in doing voluntary work abroad. I
think it is a challenge to learn to speak and communicate with a new language. I am also very curious
to learn what role theatre has in other cultures.

I expect to learn about myself. I think I will gain confidence and become more self sufficient as I will
have to create a home away from home. Notwithstanding, I am not afraid for a challenge and I look
forward to a new adventure and am open for every new experience. Not only do I expect to learn from
the program itself, but also from the people who live in the country and the other volunteers that come
from many cultures and can hopefully teach me values that I will carry with me for life. I hope that the
possibility exists for me to join your project as a volunteer.

I am really looking forward to hear from you!

Dear Sir or Madam:

With the enclosed application and supporting documentation, I am expressing my sincere interest in
being accepted into the master of International Management graduate program at The American Graduate
School of International Management.

I am extremely well equipped for graduate studies in international business, and I feel certain I could
one day become a distinguished alumnus of your fine institution. As you will see from my resume, I already
hold B.S. degree in Business and Marketing and I read, write, and speak Spanish fluently. My Spanish
Language Skills were refined as an intelligence professional and Spanish linguist in the U.S. Army, and I
traveled extensively throughout Latin and Central America working on projects related to making our country
safer from illegal drugs and weapons.

In addition to my experience as a military professional and Spanish linguist, I believe my extensive
work experience will also help to make me a valuable part of the MIM program. While working in summer and
part-time jobs to finance my college education, I excelled in positions as an assistant retail manager, sales

As you will see when you read my essay, my goal is to become the chief executive officer of a company

studies offered by the American Graduate School of International Business, will help me achieve that aim. I am
committed to helping my community, and I offer an extensive ""track record"" of volunteer service, which is
summarized, on my resume. I feel I would be a credit to the business community because of my strong
conviction that the economic necessity to make a profit must be balanced by concern for customers and respect
for employees.

I can assure you in advance that I would be a credit to the next entering class and as a graduate. Thank
