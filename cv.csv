Desidered Employment and Current Skills
System Administrator, DBA, Programmer, Consultant

Over the years, thanks to my thirst for knowledge, I have gained extensive experience in
computer science ranging from operating systems to programming languages and platforms
upon which the latter are based. Along this path I have continued to improve my approach
to problems always trying to implement optimal, generalized and reusable solutions (OOP,
Design Patterns). In some academic work opportunities I've been able to demonstrate excellent

teamwork skills and capability to collaborate with external groups. Another virtue I possess is

 

the ability to solve almost any computer problem thanks to the excellent information gathering
skills and the many years of experience in the computer science field.
